# oddly_specific_discord-bots
Personal Discord bots that I created specifically because I was bored. 
Current language: Python (Converting to JS soon).
These bots are running on Docker (Upload dockerfile soon).

**List:**
* **Weatherie** : A weather monitoring and reporting bot with mostly hourly or daily tasks.
* **Wordie** : A Wordle results monitoring bot that checks for new stats and saves them.
* **Geminie** : A bot that will just call Gemini in a Discord text channel.
* **Petie** : A bot that will fetch a random or newest pet image from configured subreddit hourly.
